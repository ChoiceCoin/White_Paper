# Choice Coin White Paper
This Repository hosts the official white paper for Choice Coin, an Algogrand Standard Asset built for governance, voting, and decentralized democracy. Choice Coin is an open source project, and all software is available under the Apache License. To view the White Paper, click the file link located in this Repository - **Choice_White_Paper.pdf** - and download the paper at your election. The White Paper is shows the design principles and mathmatical theory behind the Choice Coin DAO. Over time, a lot has changed since the paper was originally written, but the guiding principles remain. Perhaps the biggest change since the White Paper was originally published was removing the freeze and clawback functions to decentralize asset control - more on which can be found below.
