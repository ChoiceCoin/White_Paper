The White Paper is shows the design principles and mathmatical theory behind the Choice Coin DAO. 

Over time, a lot has changed since the paper was originally written, but the guiding principles remain. Perhaps the biggest change since the White Paper was originally published was removing the freeze and clawback functions to decentralize asset control. [Update](https://medium.com/@ChoiceCoin/decentralizing-asset-control-7454f5527adc) on removing freeze and clawback function to decentralize asset control. 

In May of 2022, the [Choice Coin v2 White Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4111692) was published. Thank you to the Choice Coin Community and the Algorand Community for your continued support!
